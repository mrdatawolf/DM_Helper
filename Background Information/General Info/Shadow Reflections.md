# Shadow Reflections - The Pattern Mirrors

## Overview

Just as Amber has its reflections in Rebma and Tir-na Nog'th, so too does Deidre - the first shadow of Corwin's Pattern. These reflections follow similar metaphysical principles but are colored by Corwin's Pattern rather than the First Pattern.

## The First Pattern Reflections

### Amber (Kolvir)
- **Order Level**: 100/100
- **Pattern Influence**: First Pattern
- The eternal city, seat of the true Pattern

### Rebma
- **Order Level**: 98/100
- **Pattern Influence**: First Pattern
- The underwater mirror of Amber, approached by descending Faiella-bionin's grand staircase
- Everything is reversed, the Pattern runs backward
- Ruled by Queen Moire
- Serves as both sanctuary and prison

### Tir-na Nog'th
- **Order Level**: 92/100
- **Pattern Influence**: First Pattern
- The ghost city in the sky, appearing only on nights of the full moon
- Reached by climbing an invisible stairway above the clouds
- Everything exists in shades of silver and shadow
- The Pattern runs in reverse, showing possible futures
- Prophecy and memory intertwined
- **Corruption**: Temporal instability - prophetic visions may bleed between timelines

## The Corwin Pattern Reflections

### Deidre
- **Order Level**: 95/100
- **Pattern Influence**: Corwin Pattern
- The first shadow of Corwin's Pattern, named in memory of his sister
- **Aesthetic**: Noir-tinged reflection of Amber
- Eternal twilight casts long shadows across art deco spires
- Jazz echoes through rain-slicked streets
- Neon signs flicker in shades of deep crimson and electric blue
- Order maintained through a web of intrigue and shadowy alliances
- The city pulses with melancholic beauty

### The Depths
- **Order Level**: 90/100
- **Pattern Influence**: Corwin Pattern
- Deidre's reflection beneath dark waters
- **Not** underwater like Rebma, but submerged in a sea of liquid shadow
- Accessed through mirrors when rain falls in Deidre
- Where Rebma is crystalline and bright, The Depths are obsidian and secretive
- The reversed Pattern pulses with deep indigo light
- Reveals truths that the surface world hides

### The Neon Spire
- **Order Level**: 88/100
- **Pattern Influence**: Corwin Pattern
- Deidre's ghost twin, manifesting during the **new moon** (opposite of Tir-na Nog'th's full moon)
- Appears as an inverted reflection in Deidre's perpetual rain puddles
- Where Tir-na Nog'th is silver and ethereal, The Neon Spire is electric and vivid
- A fever dream of what Deidre could become
- The Pattern runs in neon colors, crackling with possibility
- Shows not prophecy, but **choices** - alternate paths and decisions
- **Corruption**: Choice-flux - decisions made here ripple backward through probability

## Metaphysical Patterns

### The First Pattern (Dworkin's Creation)
- **Reflections**: Reversed (Rebma) and Future-showing (Tir-na Nog'th)
- **Timing**: Full moon for Tir-na Nog'th
- **Aesthetic**: Silver, crystalline, classical
- **Nature**: Deterministic - shows what will be

### Corwin's Pattern
- **Reflections**: Shadow-based (The Depths) and Choice-showing (The Neon Spire)
- **Timing**: New moon for The Neon Spire, rain-triggered for The Depths
- **Aesthetic**: Neon, noir, electric, modern
- **Nature**: Probabilistic - shows what could be

## Campaign Implications

1. **Access**: Characters who can walk Corwin's Pattern might access The Depths and The Neon Spire more easily than Amberites can

2. **Knowledge**: The Neon Spire's choice-based visions are fundamentally different from Tir-na Nog'th's prophecies - they show branches, not destiny

3. **Corruption**: Both reflection cities show signs of instability that their prime cities (Amber/Deidre) don't display - suggesting the reflection process magnifies weaknesses

4. **Mirrors**: The Depths can be accessed through mirrors in Deidre during rain - suggesting a symbolic connection between reflection (mirrors) and the rain-slicked noir aesthetic

5. **Moon Phases**:
   - Full moon = Tir-na Nog'th (First Pattern, future-seeing)
   - New moon = The Neon Spire (Corwin Pattern, choice-seeing)
   - This opposition may be significant

## Story Hooks

- What happens when someone walks both Patterns and tries to access both reflection cities simultaneously?
- Can The Depths and Rebma connect? Two underwater reflections from different Patterns?
- What if the "choice-flux" corruption spreads from The Neon Spire to Deidre proper?
- Are there other reflection cities yet to be discovered for other major shadows?

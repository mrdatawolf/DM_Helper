# Amber adventure

## The Shadow Realm

1. The player meets a Shadow Eater and finds that it is sentient. She will see it destroying her world by tearing it apart and exposing “something” beyond it with every tear. Things for her to learn:  
   1. The being is driven by the knowledge that it must restore balance  
   2. It is intelligent  
   3. It is not evil  
   4. There is a deeper structure to the realms something below or outside the world she knows  
   5. It hungers to eat “The chaos”  
   6. You see it use **Resonant Translocation** and it occurs to you what it is doing: By sensing the unique resonance of the adjacent reality it came from, your players might use their Order magic to attune themselves to that frequency. They could then attempt to translocate themselves across the boundary, much like how a tuning fork resonates with its counterpart when struck.  
   7. Maybe learns:  
      1. She could draw power from it.  But the drawing of power causes an explosion as the chaos touches it. Because it is a agent of order.  
   8. Dialogue:  
      1. "I am a servant of the pattern, elf. My purpose is to maintain the harmony of Order."  
      2. *"I do not destroy, I restore. The balance must be maintained."*  
      3. *"Chaos infects the fabric of this realm, I must cut out the rot. Your world is but one thread in the tapestry."*  
      4. "I sense the weight of chaos and order waring in you, elf. It is a heavy burden to bear."  
      5. "The realms are not as they seem. There is more beneath the surface than meets the eye."  
      6. "I am drawn to the chaos that seeps into these worlds. It is a siren's call I cannot resist."  
      7.   
   9. Description:  
      1. "As I gaze into its ethereal form, I see wisps of iridescent mist swirling around a core of luminous, shifting hues. The colors seem to pulse with an otherworldly energy, as if they're alive and responding to some unseen rhythm."  
      2. "The Shadow Eater's presence is like a whispered promise of transformation, its being a mesmerizing dance of smoke and light that shifts and changes before my very eyes."  
      3. "Its form undulates and flows like the surface of a restless sea, with tendrils of misty color reaching out as if to touch or taste the world around it."  
      4. "The colors seem to bleed into one another, creating an ever-shifting tapestry of hues that's both mesmerizing and disorienting. It's as if I'm staring into the very heart of chaos itself."  
      5. "As the Shadow Eater moves, its form seems to blur and blend with the shadows around it, making it difficult to discern where the being ends and the darkness begins."  
   10. Describing a shadow eaters bite of shadow:  
       1. "As the Shadow Eater's tendrils of misty color reach out to consume the shadow, you see the darkness begin to unravel like a thread pulled from a tapestry. The fabric of reality seems to part, revealing a gleaming, crystalline layer that shimmers with an unearthly light."  
       2. "As the Shadow Eater tears into the shadow, it releases a burst of iridescent energy that sears your vision. The veil between worlds appears to rip apart, exposing the luminous expanse beyond – a realm where stars and galaxies seem to coexist in harmony."  
       3. "As the Shadow Eater devours the shadow, you feel the fabric of reality quiver and flex, as if the very walls of existence are being rent asunder. A brilliant, shimmering layer is revealed, its beauty both captivating and terrifying – a glimpse into the infinite expanse that lies beyond our mortal realm."  
       4. “As the Shadow Eater cuts thru the world it leaves behind a gleaming darkness colored like an open C left hanging in the air”  
       5. "The Shadow Eater's touch imbues the darkness with an otherworldly hue, like the lingering resonance of an open C, impossible to grasp yet seared into the mind."  
       6. "As the Shadow Eater devours the shadow, it leaves behind a glimmering abyss, its color reminiscent of the haunting depth of an unstruck C string – a sound that exists beyond the reach of mortal ears."  
       7. "The darkness dissolves, revealing a void of shimmering indigo, like the echo of an open C lingering in the silence – a color that defies the spectrum and yet is palpable in its absence."  
       8. "The Shadow Eater's bite tears through reality, exposing a realm of iridescent shadow, its color akin to the unuttered note of a cello's lowest string – a sound that whispers secrets beyond human comprehension."

* Its very being seems to have an impact on the fabric of reality, causing distortions in the space-time continuum.  
* It is drawn to areas with high concentrations of chaos, where it can feed and grow stronger.  
  2. Spells:  
     1. **Resonant Translocation**  
        1. **Resonance Tuning**: When attempting Resonant Translocation, your players will need to tune their minds and bodies to the resonance frequency of the adjacent reality. This could be achieved through meditation, focus, or even a ritualistic process that helps them attune themselves.  
        2. **Sensory Perception**: The players might experience a heightened sense of awareness during Resonant Translocation, allowing them to perceive the underlying energies and patterns in the environment. This could grant them insights into the nature of the adjacent reality, its inhabitants, or potential challenges they'll face.  
        3. **Risk of Discord**: If the players fail to perfectly tune their resonance, they might experience a temporary 'discord' that disrupts their connection to the Pattern. This could result in physical discomfort, mental disorientation, or even a brief loss of consciousness as their minds struggle to realign with the new reality.  
        4. **Chaos-Induced Variations**: The more chaotic the environment surrounding the Shadow Eater, the more unpredictable the outcome of Resonant Translocation might be. This could lead to variations in the destination, such as arriving at a different location within the adjacent reality or even being transported through multiple realities before settling on the desired one.

Eggari

Medium beast, chaotic neutral

Armor Class: 16 (natural armor) Hit Points: 45 (6d8 \+ 18\) Speed: 30 ft., fly 60 ft.

STR: 14 (+2) DEX: 18 (+4) CON: 16 (+3) INT: 2 (-4) WIS: 10 (+0) CHA: 6 (-2)

Damage Immunities: Poison Condition Immunities: Charmed, Frightened, Paralyzed, Petrified, Poisoned Senses: darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 12 Languages: understands Eggari clicks and chirps, telepathic communication with other Eggari

Special Abilities

* Chaos Attraction: Eggari are drawn to areas of intense chaos, such as the aftermath of a powerful spell or a magical cataclysm. They can sense these disturbances from up to 1 mile away.  
* Nexus Lairs: Eggari seek out nexus points in the Shadow Realm, where they establish their lairs and feed on the accumulated chaos. These lairs are often connected to ley lines, allowing the Eggari to siphon off chaotic energy.  
* Flight: Eggari can fly at a speed of 60 feet, using their two wings for propulsion.

Reactions

* Chaos Feeding: When an Eggari is within 5 feet of a nexus point or a concentrated area of chaos, it can make a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to feed on the chaotic energy. On a success, it regains 10 hit points and gains advantage on its next attack roll.  
* Social Behavior: While Eggari don't work together, they also don't engage in combat with each other or try to take over one another's lairs. They tend to ignore each other unless competing for the same chaos-rich area.  
* Lore:  
  * In the Shadow Realm, the Eggari have long been a mysterious presence, their origins shrouded in myth and legend. The Elevi, a fae race of skilled mages and craftsmen, whisper tales of the Eggari's ancient connection to the chaos that permeates their world.  
  * According to Elevi lore, the Eggari were once mere eggs, imbued with chaotic energy by the whims of the Shadow Realm's ruling class, the First Pattern. Over time, these eggs hatched into the winged, serpentine creatures known as the Eggari. As they grew in power and numbers, the Eggari began to sense the subtle disturbances caused by the Elevi's magic, drawn to the concentrated chaos like moths to a flame.  
  * Unbeknownst to both the ruling class of the First Pattern and the Elevi, the Eggari have developed a symbiotic relationship with the Shadow Realm. By feeding on the accumulated chaos at nexus points, they strengthen their own powers and contribute to the gradual increase in their numbers. This slow rise in Eggari populations is a natural consequence of the ruling class's actions, as the First Pattern continues to extract Order from sentient beings, inadvertently amplifying the chaotic forces that nourish the Eggari.  
  * The Elevi, while aware of the Eggari's existence and their connection to chaos, are perplexed by the creatures' behavior. They observe that the Eggari rarely interact with each other, instead focusing on their solitary pursuits of feeding and growth. Despite this enigmatic nature, the Elevi have come to respect the Eggari as a force of balance in the Shadow Realm, acknowledging their role in maintaining the delicate equilibrium between Order and Chaos.  
  * As the ruling class remains oblivious to the consequences of their actions, the Eggari continue to thrive, their numbers growing with each passing cycle. The fate of the Shadow Realm hangs in the balance, as the interplay between Order and Chaos shapes the destiny of its inhabitants – including the Elevi, the ruling class, and the enigmatic Eggari.  
3. Other races  
   1. **Elevi**  
* The Elevi are a fae race native to the Shadow Realm, known for their exceptional magical abilities and craftsmanship.  
* They possess a deep connection to the natural world and the cycles of life and death within the Shadow.  
* Elevi society is organized into tribes, each with its own unique culture, traditions, and specialties. Despite these differences, they share a common reverence for the land, the patterns of magic, and the balance between Order and Chaos.  
* They are skilled in many forms of magic, including illusion, transmutation, and elemental manipulation. Elevi mages often specialize in specific areas, such as nature magic or divination.  
* Physical Appearance: Elevi typically range from 5 to 6 feet in height, with slender builds and delicate features. Their skin has a subtle shimmer, reflecting the colors of the Shadow Realm's landscape. They have pointed ears, long hair that changes color depending on their emotions, and eyes that can see into the spirit realms.  
  * **Other Fae Creatures:**  
1. **Glimmerwings (Luminari)**  
* Glimmerwings are small, iridescent winged creatures that inhabit the fringes of the Shadow Realm towns and cities.  
* They have a natural affinity for light and darkness, often flitting between these two states as they move through the world.  
* Luminari are known for their mischievous nature, playing tricks on travelers who stumble upon them. Despite this, they are not malevolent and will sometimes aid those in need if approached with respect and kindness.  
* Physical Appearance: Glimmerwings have delicate, crystalline bodies that refract light into a dazzling array of colors. They range from 6 to 12 inches in length, with wingspans of up to 2 feet.  
2. **Moonstalkers (Umbrari)**  
   * Moonstalkers are mysterious, wolf-like creatures that roam the Shadow Realm under the cover of darkness.  
     * They possess a deep connection to the lunar cycles and the mysteries of the night, often seeking out hidden places where the veil between worlds is thin.  
       * Umbrari are known for their stealth and cunning, able to move unseen through the shadows like ghosts. They are fiercely independent and rarely form close bonds with other creatures.

# About the general story

1. The Shadow Realm is a realm in the second order of shadows outside of Kolvir .  
2. The Logrus corrupted the Shadow Realm when Corwin was creating the new pattern, weakening its claim as the true form of order and the original Pattern helped the Logrus.  
3. Corwin's Pattern knew about the disturbance but was initially unaware of the corruption due to the combined efforts of the other two powers (the Logrus and the Pattern) hiding this information from it.  
4. As Corwin's Pattern grew in power, it created the Shadow Eaters to address the destabilizing effects of the chaos-spreading shadow.  
   Yes, you are correct again\! The First Pattern, seeking to expand its dominion and incorporate the Kolvir shadows, worked with the Logrus to corrupt the Shadow Realm. This collaboration allowed the First Pattern to gain a foothold in the Shadow Realm and begin to exert its influence, which would eventually allow it to "break into" the Kolvir shadows.  
5. And you're absolutely right about the inhabitants of the Shadow Realm and their unique ability to draw Order from sentient beings or even plants. This process is indeed a source of magic for them, but as you noted, it also has an unintended consequence: the Chaos imbalance that arises from this extraction of Order causes random, chaotic events to occur, further increasing the level of Chaos in the Shadow Realm.  
6. This Chaotic influence then begins to seep into adjacent shadows, slowly corrupting and destabilizing the multiverse. This is a key aspect of the Amber mythos, as it highlights the delicate balance between Order and Chaos and the consequences of disrupting that balance.

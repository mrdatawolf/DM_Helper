The Soul Realm lies near to Kolvir and therefore Corwin’s primal pattern.  
The magic that is performed is pulling order out of beings. This causes a vacuum that draws Chaos to the being and this leads to a growing problem for Corwin’s Pattern as it is corrupted by this deep intrusion of Chaos into its domain.

The Soul Realm's unique connection to order and chaos could lead to novel magical properties or limitations for its inhabitants. For example, magic users in this realm might struggle with maintaining balance within themselves, making them more susceptible to chaotic influences.

Things that might be explored with the Soul Realm:

1. **Mysterious Beginnings**: The players might uncover the ancient origins of The Soul Realm, revealing how it was created and its initial connection to Corwin's Pattern.  
2. **Hidden Knowledge**: As they explore the realm, they could discover hidden knowledge or ancient artifacts that hold the key to understanding and mitigating the growing chaos.  
3. **Chaos-Infused Quests**: The players might embark on quests to contain or redirect the chaotic energies, potentially leading them to other shadows, realms, or even Amber itself.

The Original Pattern is using it’s power to hide where the corruption to the new pattern is coming from.  This is why Kolvir doesn’t even know the Soul Realm is a problem.  It’s been hidden since nearly the beginning.  And the Logrus believes it was cheated when Corwin made a second pattern and want to swallow it to “restore the balance”.

The soul realm and the being in it are of Kolvir fully.  Except the wizards.  Their blood allows them to cast spells because they are injected into the shadow by the first Pattern with the help of the Logrus. They have somehow created dual beings of their two powers. Currently the wizards only know how to draw order out of beings but they could also draw power from the chaos of the beings thereby becoming much more powerful and potentially restoring balance.

The Kolvir Pattern will make an offer to the players at some point to help it solidify it’s control of it’s shadows.  What will this mean for the wizards?

* The players must grapple with their own moral code and decide whether to support the Kolvir Pattern's efforts to destroy the Shadow Eaters.  
* The wizards, who have a deep connection to both the Logrus and Chaos, might be torn between their loyalty to the Kolvir Pattern and their understanding of the Shadow Eaters' role in maintaining balance.  
* The Shadow Eaters themselves could become more intelligent or even develop their own motivations, leading to a complex web of alliances and rivalries.

## Campaign Setting Overview

This campaign is set in the **Chronicles of Amber** multiverse, where:

- **Amber** is the one true world, seat of the original Pattern
- **The Courts of Chaos** oppose Amber, home to the Logrus
- **Shadows** are infinite reflections of these primal forces
- **Corwin's Pattern** - a second Pattern created by Prince Corwin, now locked in a three-way power struggle
- Magic, reality, and perception are deeply intertwined

You are not playing members of the Amber royal family (unless arranged with the DM), but rather inhabitants of the Shadow realms who may become entangled in the cosmic struggle between the Patterns and the Logrus.

### Key Differences from Traditional D&D
- **Shadows instead of Planes**: Each "world" is a shadow of Amber or the Courts
- **Order vs Chaos**: Replaces alignment; a measurable force affecting magic and reality
- **Pattern Powers**: Walking the Pattern or Logrus grants reality-warping abilities
- **Asynchronous Play**: Characters may adventure separately, in parallel timelines
- **Perception Matters**: What you *believe* about others affects how you interact with them

## Rule Changes from Standard D&D 5e

### 1. Feat & Leveling System

We use a custom progression system instead of standard XP:

#### Earning Feats
You gain **feats** (not to be confused with D&D feats - these are point resources) through:
- **1 feat per session** attended
- **1 feat when you level up**
- **1 feat for "Unknown Unknown" moments** (transcendent breakthrough)

#### Using Feats
Feats can be spent to:
- Gain **Claim Points** for the Attribute Claims system (1 feat = 1 claim point)
- Attempt actions beyond your current capabilities
- Unlock new abilities or insights

#### Action Difficulty Tiers

**Known (Cost: 0 feats)**
- Automatic success
- Examples: Routine magic you've mastered, sword forms practiced for years
- No roll needed

**Known but Challenging (Cost: 0 feats)**
- Normal D&D roll
- Examples: Combat against a worthy opponent, casting under pressure
- You know what to do, but success isn't guaranteed

**Unknown but Beyond (Cost: 1 feat + Natural 20)**
- Breaking through to a new level
- Examples: Defeating someone you previously couldn't, solving an "impossible" problem
- Requires spending 1 feat AND rolling a natural 20
- Represents: "I'm better than my older brother now, but didn't realize it"

**Unknown Unknown (Cost: 2 feats + roll 15+)**
- A quantum leap in ability
- Examples: Neo dodging bullets, walking the Pattern, merging incompatible magics
- Requires 2 feats AND rolling 15 or higher
- Represents: "A leap above even where you can see yourself being"
- Grants an additional feat for "riding high" on the breakthrough

#### Leveling
- Track **points toward your next level**
- Earn points through:
  - 1 point per session
  - 1 point for each "Unknown but Beyond" success
  - Immediate level-up for "Unknown Unknown" success (enlightenment moment)

### 2. Order & Chaos Balance

Instead of alignment, your character has an **Order/Chaos Balance** (0-100):
- **100 = Pure Order**: Rigid, predictable, structured magic
- **50 = Balanced**: Can draw from both forces
- **0 = Pure Chaos**: Wild, unpredictable, transformative magic

**How it Changes:**
- Drawing power from Order/Chaos sources shifts your balance
- Walking the Pattern pulls you toward Order
- Walking the Logrus pulls you toward Chaos
- Certain shadows naturally shift your balance

**Why it Matters:**
- Affects magic effectiveness
- Determines which powers you can learn
- Influences how NPCs react to you
- Can open or close narrative paths

### 3. Session-by-Session Progress Tracking

Unlike traditional D&D where the party is always together, this campaign tracks individual character storylines:

- **Solo Sessions**: You may have private adventures
- **Group Sessions**: Multiple characters adventuring together
- **Parallel Timelines**: Your character's story progresses independently
- **Story Beats**: We track key moments in your narrative arc

## The Attribute Claims System

This is our version of the **Amber Diceless RPG auction**, adapted for asynchronous play.

### The Core Concept

Instead of rolling to see who's better at something, you **claim superiority** by spending **Claim Points**. The character with the most points invested in an attribute is **objectively better** at it.

### How It Works

**Starting Pool:**
- You begin with **10 Claim Points**
- You can allocate these at character creation or save them for later
- You can earn more points through gameplay (DM grants)

**Making Claims:**
To claim superiority in an attribute (Warfare, Sorcery, Strength, etc.):
1. Decide how many points to invest
2. Provide **narrative justification** (why is your character this good?)
3. Compare to existing claims

**Beat to Lead:**
- To surpass an existing claim, you must **exceed** their points
- Current leader has 4 points → You need 5 points to beat them
- Ties are possible and create interesting rivalries

**Example:**
```
CHARACTER CLAIMS IN "WARFARE"
1. Sir Kael: 5 points - "Trained since childhood in Deidre's noir combat pits"
2. Aelindra: 2 points - "Self-taught defense against Soul Realm predators"
3. Torven: 5 points - "Former general of Billabong's warrior caste" [Tied for 1st!]
```

### Perception vs Reality (The Secret)

Here's the twist: **You don't see the actual rankings**.

When you look at other characters' abilities, you see what **your character believes** about them, which may be wrong!

**What You See:**
- Your own actual claim points (you know yourself)
- Your **perceptions** of others' abilities (possibly inaccurate)

**What the DM Sees:**
- Everyone's actual claim points (the truth)
- Everyone's perceptions of each other (the beliefs)

**Why This Matters:**
Like Corwin believing Eric was the best swordsman (when he wasn't), your character might:
- Overestimate a rival due to reputation
- Underestimate an ally you haven't seen in action
- Be surprised when someone you thought weak defeats you
- Use misinformation strategically

**Example:**
```
REALITY (DM knows):
- Kael: 5 points in Warfare
- Aelindra: 4 points in Sorcery

KAEL'S PERCEPTION:
- Self: 5 points in Warfare (accurate - knows himself)
- Aelindra: 6 points in Sorcery (overestimate - saw her impressive display)

AELINDRA'S PERCEPTION:
- Self: 4 points in Sorcery (accurate)
- Kael: 7 points in Warfare (overestimate - intimidated by his reputation)
```

### How to Increase Claims

You can allocate more points to an attribute at any time if you can justify it:

**Good Justifications:**
- "After training with the Shadow Eaters, I've learned to manipulate Chaos directly" (+2 to Sorcery)
- "Walking Corwin's Pattern has fundamentally changed my understanding of reality" (+3 to Pattern Mastery)
- "I spent three months studying ancient Elevi texts in the Soul Realm archives" (+2 to Scholarship)

**Bad Justifications:**
- "I want to be stronger" (no narrative reason)
- "It's been a while" (too vague)
- "Just because" (no justification at all)

### Suggested Attributes

You can create claims in any attribute, but here are common categories:

**Amber Powers:**
- Pattern Mastery
- Logrus Mastery
- Trump Artistry
- Shadow Walking
- Shape Shifting

**Combat:**
- Warfare (overall combat prowess)
- Strength
- Endurance
- Strategy & Tactics
- Specific weapon styles

**Mental/Social:**
- Scholarship
- Psyche (mental combat/defense)
- Diplomacy
- Subterfuge
- Intimidation

**Magic (Campaign-Specific):**
- Sorcery (Order Manipulation) - Soul Realm specialty
- Blood Magic - Soul Realm forbidden art
- Chaos Magic
- Resonant Translocation
- Bio-Magic - Billabong's Veil specialty

### Strategic Considerations

**Should you challenge existing claims?**
- Challenging costs more points (you must beat them)
- Sometimes it's better to claim a new attribute
- Rivalries can be fun narratively

**Should you spend all your points at creation?**
- No! Save points for character development
- You might discover new abilities
- Flexibility is valuable

**Should you set false perceptions?**
- Work with your DM on this
- Underestimating foes can create drama
- Overestimating allies can lead to surprises

## Character Creation

### Step 1: Choose Your Starting Shadow
See [Available Starting Shadows](#available-starting-shadows) below.

### Step 2: Standard D&D 5e Creation
- Choose race (or use custom races from starting shadow)
- Choose class
- Roll/assign ability scores
- Select background

### Step 3: Amber-Specific Attributes
Determine:
- **Shadow Origin**: Which shadow you're from
- **Blood Purity** (if from Soul Realm): Pure, Half, or None
- **Order/Chaos Balance**: Start at 50 (neutral) or discuss with DM
- **Pattern/Logrus Connection**: Do you have any connection to these powers?

### Step 4: Allocate Claim Points
- You have 10 claim points
- Review existing character claims (if any)
- Decide which attributes to claim
- Provide justifications for each claim
- Consider saving some points for later

### Step 5: Set Initial Perceptions (Optional)
- Discuss with DM what your character has heard about others
- Set perceived rankings based on rumors, demonstrations, or history
- Remember: These may be wrong!

## The Multiverse & Shadows

### How Shadows Work

Think of reality as a spectrum:
- **Amber (Pure Order)** ← → **Courts of Chaos (Pure Chaos)**
- Everything in between is a **Shadow**

Shadows are not separate dimensions - they're **reflections** of the primal forces:
- Shadows closer to Amber are more orderly, stable, predictable
- Shadows closer to Chaos are more malleable, chaotic, magical
- **Shadow Walking**: Moving between shadows by focusing on differences

### The Three Powers

**The First Pattern (Amber)**
- The original Pattern created by Dworkin
- Source of Order in the multiverse
- Grants reality-warping power to those who walk it
- Jealously guards its dominion

**The Logrus (Courts of Chaos)**
- The counterbalance to the Pattern
- Source of Chaos in the multiverse
- Grants shape-shifting and probability manipulation
- Seeks to expand chaos throughout shadows

**Corwin's Pattern**
- A second Pattern created by Prince Corwin
- Neither Pattern nor Logrus fully accepts it
- Creates its own shadows
- Offers a "third way" between Order and Chaos

### Shadow Reflections

Major shadows have **reflections** - mirror versions that reveal truths:

**For Amber (First Pattern):**
- **Rebma**: Underwater mirror, Pattern runs backward
- **Tir-na Nog'th**: Sky city (full moon), shows possible futures

**For Deidre (Corwin Pattern):**
- **The Depths**: Liquid shadow mirror, reveals hidden truths
- **The Neon Spire**: Rain reflection (new moon), shows choices

These reflection cities are dangerous, prophetic, and revealing. See [Shadow Reflections](Background%20Information/General%20Info/Shadow%20Reflections.md) for details.

## Getting Started

### What You Need to Know

1. **This isn't standard D&D** - We blend D&D 5e mechanics with Amber concepts
2. **Your story matters** - Character development and narrative are as important as stats
3. **Perception is reality** - What you believe about others affects gameplay
4. **Async is normal** - You may adventure solo or with others; both are valid
5. **Justification required** - Power gains need narrative support

### Questions to Consider

Before creating your character:
- Which starting shadow appeals to you?
- What kind of power interests you? (Order magic? Chaos? Combat? Scholarship?)
- How does your character view Order vs Chaos?
- What are your character's ambitions?
- What claims do you want to make? (Wait to see what others have claimed first!)

### Working with the DM

Your DM tracks:
- Your actual claim points (truth)
- Your perceptions of others (what you believe)
- Your Order/Chaos shifts
- Your story progression
- Your feat pool and spending

You see:
- Your own stats and claims
- Your perceptions of others (which may be wrong!)
- Your available feats and claim points
- Your current shadow and story status
